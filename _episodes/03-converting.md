teaching: 5
exercises: 0
questions:
- "How can I convert the certificate I just downloaded to get a grid proxy?"
objectives:
- "Know the `openssl` commands to convert from `p12` to `pem`."
- "Be aware of where the `pem` files need to be located."
keypoints:
- "From the downloaded certificate two separate files need to be extracted."
- "The extracted user key and certificate files need to be in your `~/.globus` directory."
- "These files should only be readable for you."

The grid certificate needs to be converted from the file format (`*.p12`, which mean `pkcs12` format) you downloaded from the CA website (see also
[these instructions][CA_VOMS]). You will probably want to obtain the grid proxy on a
remote machine, e.g. your institute's local cluster or on LXPLUS. You therefore need
to first copy the downloaded `*.p12` to the remote machine.
The file you downloaded will probably be called `myCertificate.p12`. In the terminal,
change to the directory to which you downloaded this file (e.g. `~/Downloads`) or move
the file to your current working directory for the following commands to work without
having to adjust them.

To copy the file `*.p12` For example, when using LXPLUS, do the following:

~~~
scp myCertificate.p12 lxplus.cern.ch:~/
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Then log on to an LXPLUS machine:

~~~
ssh lxplus.cern.ch
~~~
{: .language-bash}

All following commands will be executed on LXPLUS (or the remote machine of your choice).
However, they could also work on your local computer in case you would like to obtain a
GRID proxy there, but this cannot be guaranteed.

The files that we will generate from the `*.p12` file need to be put into a directory
within your home directory to be discovered automatically. Let's create this directory
if it doesn't exist yet, and delete possibly old files therein:

~~~
mkdir -p ~/.globus
rm -f ~/.globus/usercert.pem
rm -f ~/.globus/userkey.pem
~~~
{: .language-bash}

From the `*.p12` file we will need to extract a user certificate and a user key. Let's start extracting the user certificate:

~~~
openssl pkcs12 -in myCertificate.p12 -clcerts -nokeys -out ~/.globus/usercert.pem
~~~
{: .language-bash}

This will ask for the import password that you set before downloading the file from the CA:

~~~
Enter Import Password:
MAC verified OK
~~~
{: .output}

Now on to obtaining the `userkey.pem`:

~~~
openssl pkcs12 -in myCertificate.p12 -nocerts -out ~/.globus/userkey.pem
~~~
{: .language-bash}

This will again ask for the import password as above, and in addition will ask you to enter a `PEM pass phrase`. This is the password that you will have to enter each time you would like to obtain a new VOMS proxy, remember it well.

~~~
Enter Import Password:
MAC verified OK
Enter PEM pass phrase:
Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase:
~~~
{: .output}

One thing that is important are correct access rights (or file modes). Only you should be able to read the `userkey.pem`. Execute the following commands for this purpose:

~~~
chmod 600 ~/.globus/userkey.pem
chmod 600 ~/.globus/usercert.pem
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Now you need to move the files to the correct location to be discovered automatically, which is in your home directory:

Try if this works:

~~~
voms-proxy-init --voms cms
~~~
{: .language-bash}

This will ask for you `GRID pass phrase`, which is the `PEM pass phrase` you set above. The output should then be similar to what is shown below:

~~~
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
Contacting voms2.cern.ch:15002 [/DC=ch/DC=cern/OU=computers/CN=voms2.cern.ch] "cms"...
Remote VOMS server contacted succesfully.


Created proxy in /tmp/x509up_u501.

Your proxy is valid until Wed Aug 12 22:15:57 CEST 2020
